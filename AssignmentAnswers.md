# pyBKT Assignment Answers

## Question 1

The program outputs this:

```
Standard BKT: 0.7453090179133423
BKT+Forgets: 0.7821308881819574
```

The difference between them is 0.0368, with the model the forgetting parameter having a greater accuracy. 

## Question 2

'Plot Pi' appears to be the easiest to learn.

## Question 3

'Plot terminating proper fraction' appears to be the hardest to learn.

## Question 4

'Plot whole number' is the easiest to guess.

## Question 5

'Plot non-terminating improper fraction' appears to be the hardest to guess.

## Question 6

The model with the forgetting parameter is more accurate by roughly .05. So not too much.

## Question 7

'Calculate unit rate' was the easiest to forget.

## Question 8

'Plot non-terminating improper fraction' was the hardest to forget. 

## Question 9

### Question 8

Plotting a non-terminating improper fraction is hardest to forget because, in my opinion, doing that requires knowledge that was learned in elementary school.
It is based on something more foundational.

### Question 2

Plotting pi is easiest to learn because, in my opinion, it is similar to the previous question in that pi is a very foundational value that was learned
early on in math education.
