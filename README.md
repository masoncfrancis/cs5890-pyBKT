Submission by Mason Francis

## Assignment contents

You can find the code used in [BasicForgets.py](BasicForgets.py). **Important:** The code used in the assignment added another 
library to pretty-print the json, so you will need to install it if you run that. Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

You can find my answers to the assignment in [AssignmentAnswers.md](AssignmentAnswers.md).
